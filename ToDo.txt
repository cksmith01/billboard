*** TODO ***
- reading calendar data ... what does it look like
- refactor out BillService
- the frontend needs to get the session year from the backend rather than on the client
- consider partitioning the backend json/DB storage into folders for each year(ex: [home]/billboard/2025)
    ... if not, write an historical
... unit tests

*** DONE ***
x add dockerfile
x when no bills exist (on first run) add a toast to the main page indicating there will be data in the next 15m or so
    ... added a message
x refactor the API URLs to follow the convertion: /api/v1/...
x make sure the app can be compiled both front and backend
x make sure the app can start/run w/o any supporting files
x refactor the frontend to use the new Bill bean (rather than BillItem)
x reconfigure for SQLite DB
x create a sql DDL
x implement a job(s) to download the data from utleg.gov
    developer token: xxxxx.....
x implement a commandline runner to create the database
x missing data: onetime, ongoing, effective date ...
