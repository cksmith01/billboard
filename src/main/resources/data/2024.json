 provides that a regular primary election will be conducted as an open, top-two political primary, where:  candidates compete against all other candidates for the same office, regardless of whether the candidates are affiliated with the same political party, affiliated with different political parties, or not affiliated with a party;  all registered voters in the applicable jurisdiction may vote in the primary election for the candidates for each office, regardless of whether the candidates are affiliated with the same political party as the voter, a different political party than the voter, or no political party, and regardless of whether the voter is affiliated with a political party; and  only the candidates, equal in number to twice the number of seats to be filled for a particular office, who receive the highest number of votes at a regular primary election will advance to the regular general election for that office, regardless of whether the candidates are affiliated with the same political party, affiliated with different political parties, or not affiliated with a party;  provides that, except for candidates for president or vice president of the United States, a candidate may not participate in a regular general election unless the candidate participates in the regular primary election for that office and advances to the regular general election for that office in the manner described above;  describes the process for determining the results of a regular primary election described in this bill;  addresses candidate and officeholder vacancies;  to clarify the difference between the three existing political party types, designates a name for each political party type based on the procedures used by the political party to qualify candidates for the regular primary election ballot, as follows:  a signature-convention party, formerly called a qualified political party, where candidates may seek to qualify for the regular primary election ballot, as a candidate for the party, through convention, signature-gathering, or both;  a signature-only party, formerly referred to as a type of registered political party that is not a qualified political party, where candidates may seek to qualify for the regular primary election ballot, as a candidate for the party, only through the signature-gathering process; and  an alternate-path party, also formerly referred to as a type of registered political party that is not a qualified political party, where candidates may seek to qualify for the regular primary election ballot, as a candidate for the party, by any means designated by the party, but are listed on the ballot without any indication of party affiliation or party endorsement;  amends Election Code provisions in accordance with the open primary system and the designation of political party type;  permits a political party to decide whether voters who are affiliated with other political parties or who are unaffiliated may sign a petition to qualify an individual for placement on the primary election ballot as a candidate for the political party;  consolidates signature-gathering requirements for signature-convention parties and signature-only parties and modifies those requirements in accordance with the decision of the political party described in the preceding paragraph;
